                <h2>UN Celebration</h2>
                <p>The United Nations Day Celebration of the ECE department was an exciting day for the kids. Having practiced diligently for a month, they were very eager to wear their costumes and showcase their talents in dancing to their equally excited parents.

                    The festivity started with a parade from the ECE building to the main campus. Donned in their beautiful and colorful attires, the kindergarten students, together with their parents, paraded through the streets all the way to the gymnasium. Teachers and students from different levels warmly welcomed them with chants and cheers.
                    
                    The presence of our school administrators, teachers, and officers from the SPAS Parents’ Auxiliary and SPAS Alumni Association made the event more fun and meaningful. Watching the kids dance and have fun was truly delightful, especially for their parents who were ardently taking pictures and videos of their children.
                    
                    Garbed in their best costumes and accessories, selected candidates showed off their beautiful attire to the judges for the selection of Best in Costume, Best DIY costume, and Mr. & Ms. UN 2024 where the winners received prizes which made their day extra special.
                    
                    Behind all the fanfare, the school hopes to impart to the children that celebrating United Nations Day also means celebrating and accepting different cultures despite the race and color as we come together as one for one purpose - peace.</p>
